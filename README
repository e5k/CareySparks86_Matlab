This ﬁle presents a Matlab implementation of the Carey and Sparks (1986) model to estimate i) the plume height above sampling altitude and ii) the wind speed at the tropopause based on the compilation of isopleth maps. Figures 16 A-D of Carey and Sparks (1986) were ﬁtted using polynomial methods and interpolated for continuous ranges of clast sizes and densities.
